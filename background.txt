Then, Alex's and Lisa's fates will be determined and the player get one of the three endings. Each these 3 factors, 1.Alex get the cctv proof, 2. Sabat got convinced by Alex to be the witness to help Alex 3. Tibaru got convinced by Alex to be the witness to help Alex, can increase 33% to get the good ending, which means if Alex got all the three factors, the chance of getting the good ending is 99%. If the player didnt get the good ending, but still has at least one of the three factors listed above, then it will be the neutral ending. If the player fail to get any of the three factors, it will be the bad ending. After principle Vega tells Alex which ending Vega choose, the game ends.

Interactive Elements & Branches
Players navigate Alex through a series of rooms and scenarios in the school, gathering clues, confronting characters, and making choices that affect the story's outcome. Each room presents a unique challenge or puzzle, emphasizing conflict resolution skills such as negotiation, empathy, and evidence gathering. It can be difficult and the difficulty level of each scene can be randomly set by ChatGPT in every round of game.

Scenes: 
Principal's Office: A crucial scene where players present their findings to Principal Vega, determining the final decision by Principle Vega. This will determine which of the three endings the player get (1. good ending 2. neutral ending 3. bad ending). After finish talking with Vega, the game is over.

School dining hall: Every characters can meet all of the other characters there, they can chat with people, making friends with others and convincing people supporting them. The dining hall is really big so usually the two sides will not have fight directly between them, but it might be possible if characters decide to do so.

School lab: this is the lab where Lisa destroyed his own project to false accuse Alex. Alex can meet tibaru here. Alex can convince her to be a witness to support Alex. But its hard because Tibaru is scared that if she be against Lisa, she can lose her job.

School CCTV room: if Alex or Charlie convinces Ou Tsi-Ming, who works for school in the CCTV room, to help them, Charlie can hack into the system and get the CCTV proof which shows evidence that Lisa destroyed his own project (Note its not a very direct evidence but can increase the possibility of getting the good endings and neutral ending and decrease the chance of getting the bad endings.) If Alex fail to convince Ou Tsi-Ming to help, it is very likely that Charlie fail to hack into the CCTV system to get the proof, even it is still a little bit possible.

Endings:
Good Ending: If players successfully gather and present enough evidence, Lisa is exposed for their actions, leading to their expulsion. Alex is exonerated, and their reputation is restored.

Tibaru be the witness in principle Veda's office 3. Goh Hiuh be the witness in principle Veda's office. Note that each of these three factor will increase the chance of getting the good ending by 33%, that means if the player get any of the two, there will be 66% chance of getting the good ending. If the player get all of the three proof, it will be 99% chance to get the good ending 
Neutral Ending: If players gather some evidence but not enough to conclusively prove Alex's innocence, Alex faces a temporary suspension. However, doubts about Lisa's integrity lead to an ongoing investigation. If the player cannot get the good ending, but still have at least one of the three proof mentioned above, it will be the neutral ending.  The three proof are 1. Alex successfully get the CCTV proof 2. Tibaru be the witness in principle Veda's office 3. Goh Hiuh be the witness in principle Veda's office.
Bad Ending: If players fail to gather sufficient evidence, Alex is expelled. Lisa's deception remains undiscovered, and Alex must find a new path outside the school.
